## Step 2. Moving the dataset to the path "Data/"
## Step 3. Runing the algorithm and adjust the parameter according to your needs
Adjusting the vary parameter (alpha, beta, epsilon) to finish the construction of PSV.
## Step 4. Loading the detection results of your trained models
The results labeled by the trained model are loaded in the algorithm and compared with Ground Truth for quantitative metrics calculation and visualization of PSV construction effects.
