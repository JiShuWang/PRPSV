# PRPSV: Parking Efficiency and Reservation Service Optimization Based on Parking Space View
## Abstract
Difficulty in parking leads to traffic congestion and hinders the further development of intelligent transportation systems. One significant reason is that the cruise parking does not fully utilize real-time information about the parking lot (e.g., availability status of the parking spaces), resulting in low parking efficiency and high parking costs. Even though reservation parking improves parking efficiency, its reservation service is coarse (e.g., could not reserve a specific parking space). Therefore, to achieve more efficient parking and optimize existing reservation services, we propose a based on real-time parking space view (PSV) framework (called PRPSV), PSV can reflect the position distribution and availability status of each parking space in a parking lot, which enables drivers to quickly and efficiently obtain real-time parking information and complete parking decisions. However, fewer studies on PSV in recent years, and these methods are high-cost, limited scalability, and do not use PSV to optimize parking efficiency and services. Therefore, we propose a method to accurately construct and update PSV based on top and side views of parking lots. Further, we model cruise and reservation modes in non-PSV and PSV-based scenarios, to compare and analyze the impact of PSV on parking efficiency. Finally, sufficient experimental results show that our proposed methods can efficiently and accurately construct and update PSV, and the introduction of PSV can effectively improve parking efficiency and optimize reservation services. Qualitative comparisons with related work and a case study in a real parking lot show that PRPSV is sufficiently feasible and scalable.
